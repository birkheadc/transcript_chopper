# Todo
  - Add mouseover to display hint functionality to FinalizeSelector
  - Create a demo for the app
  - Create supporting pages
    - Hero page?
    - Links to source code - Ask users to post issues there
    - FAQ?
  - Write more in the README
  - Track down 'Failed to load ./.env' that comes up when running dev server and building, I think it's a package that I'm not using currently.
