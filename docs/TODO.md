# Todo
  - Look into what needs to be done to actually create a production version with webpack
  - Add option to upload txt file for transcript instead of copy pasting
  - Add mouseover to display hint functionality to FinalizeSelector
  - Create a demo for the app
  - Create supporting pages
    - Welcome page
    - FAQ?
  - Write more in the README
  - Add ability to say 'nevermind' while joining or while clozing (essentially mark the current pair as do-not-create and skip it)
  - When the user clicks Go Back and returns to the Joiner component, their data should not be reset
  - Add footer content -- what do I even need in the footer?
  - Track down `unreachable code after return statement` warning in index_bundle.js:14:2 during development
  - Update `createVolumeArray` to process all channels of the supplied audio data.
  - In AudioPlayer, when hotkey is true, you have to press Play manually at least once before the hotkey starts to work
