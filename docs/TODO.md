# Todo
  - Rewrite Issue on github explaining how to solve APKG support.
  - In Slicer, change section buttons to not look like the horizontal scroll bar. Maybe move them to top of window.
  - Move more of these 'todos' into issues.
  - Add mouseover to display hint functionality to FinalizeSelector
  - Create a demo for the app
  - Create supporting pages
    - Welcome page
    - FAQ?
  - Write more in the README
  - Track down 'Failed to load ./.env' that comes up when running dev server and building, I think it's a package that I'm not using currently.
  - Refactor Joiner component to do the actual joining.
    - When joining is complete, the application should have an array of audioFile + transcript pairs. i.e., Joiner should do the actual joining.
    - This way, the next step, file generation, can simply take those pairs and create the actual zip, OR send that data to a cloze editor.
    - The end result being a less coupled cloze editor, that can be used standalone in the event that the user already has a list of shortened audio files + transcripts.
  - Add ability to say 'nevermind' while joining or while clozing (essentially mark the current pair as do-not-create and skip it)
  - Create a stylized version of an SRS clozed-text card for the welcome page
  - Add support for more customized flash card output
