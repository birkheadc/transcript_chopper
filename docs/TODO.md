# Todo
  - `webpack.prod.js` probably needs more work
  - Add mouseover to display hint functionality to FinalizeSelector
  - Create a demo for the app
  - Write more in the README
  - When the user clicks Go Back and returns to the Joiner component, their data should not be reset
  - Add footer content -- what do I even need in the footer?
  - Track down `unreachable code after return statement` warning in index_bundle.js:14:2 during development
  - Update `createVolumeArray` to process all channels of the supplied audio data, maybe?.
  - In AudioPlayer, when hotkey is true, you have to press Play manually at least once before the hotkey starts to work
  - Fix order of pairs when moving to Joiner, edit in order by start of section
    - Then, do some magic when moving to the next section, where the textarea is scrolled to the previous selection
  - Slicer needs a lot of quality of life features, easier navigation, a way to modify highlight by dragging the sides
