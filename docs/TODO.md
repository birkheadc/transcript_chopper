# Todo
  - `webpack.prod.js` probably needs more work
  - Add mouseover to display hint functionality to FinalizeSelector
  - Create a demo for the app
  - Write more in the README
  - When the user clicks Go Back and returns to the Joiner component, their data should not be reset
  - Add footer content -- what do I even need in the footer?
  - Update `createVolumeArray` to process all channels of the supplied audio data, maybe?.
